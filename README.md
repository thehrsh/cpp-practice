# C++ Basics Practice

This repository contains my practice code while learning the basics of C++ programming. I'm following a Yt playlist to build a strong foundation before moving on to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

- Variables
- Data Types
- Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Pattern Printing

## ðŸ“‚ Files Overview

| Filename         | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `first.cpp`      | First program ("Namaskar Mitroo"), basics, and operators  |
| `operators.cpp`  | Practice questions: numbers, prime, factorial, etc.       |
| `patterns.cpp`   | Star and number pattern problems                          |
| `patterns2.cpp`  | Alphabet-based pattern problems                           |



## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The purpose of this repository is :

- To practice and apply C++ concepts through code
- To track my progress as I learn the language
- To prepare for learning DSA using C++

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++). You can compile and run a file like this:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
